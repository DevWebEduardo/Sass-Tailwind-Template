**Welcome to my personal SASS/Tailwind folder semantic template repository!**
<br><br>
This repository contains a basic template for my new projects using SASS/Tailwind, with the aim of providing a more structured and organized way to manage my stylesheets.
<br><br>
Please note that I am not an expert, and this template is not intended to be a perfect or standard recommendation. I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve this template.

Feel free to use this template in your own projects or modify it to suit your needs.
